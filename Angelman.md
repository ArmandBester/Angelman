## The KIK-AS study

or

**K**nockdown of UBE3A-antisense **i**n **k**ids with **A**ngelman **s**yndrome

### The drug

GTX-102 is an antisense oligonucleotide

### The effected protein

[UBE3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7337)

#### Summary from the above link

'''*This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined*'''




#### Jargon

A **ligase** is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds between molecules, they are specific for their targets, they stick two molecules together.  The name says it all: E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase sticks E3 ubiquitin on proteins.  This then tags specific proteins to be broken down.

**Phenotype vs genotype**.  Phenotype is the observable trait, genotype is the genetics responsible for the observable trait.

## Ropes and pullies

UBE3A tags [Arc](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952117303439) for degradation. Arc controls [AMPA receptors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/ampa-receptor).  

Arc is crucial for brain plasticity.  [MIT news](https://picower.mit.edu/news/mit-scientists-discover-fundamental-rule-brain-plasticity), [Peer Reviewed Paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aao0862)

More Arc less AMPA.  An uncontrolled build-up of Arc disrupts homeostasis.  **Homeastasis** is the balancing act of living things.

'''*The AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) is a subtype of the ionotropic glutamate receptor coupled to ion channels that modulate cell excitability by gating the flow of calcium and sodium ions into the cell (Doble, 1995).*'''

## Gene editing

Althought the KIK-AS trial uses gene therapy, it is not the same as gene-editing.

[Here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33411694/) is a recent puplication on gene-editing in mice AS models. Using CRISP/Cas9 technology.
